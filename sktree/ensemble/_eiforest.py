class ExtendedIsolationForest(IsolationForest):
    """
    Extended Isolation Forest Algorithm.

    Return the anomaly score of each sample using the ExtendedIsolationForest algorithm

    The ExtendedIsolationForest 'isolates' observations by randomly selecting a
    sparse linear combination of features and then randomly selecting a split
    value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. The
    main difference from the IsolationForest algorithm is how the splits are
    computed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, default=100
        The number of base estimators in the ensemble.

    max_samples : "auto", int or float, default="auto"
        The number of samples to draw from X to train each base estimator.
            - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
            - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples.
            - If "auto", then `max_samples=min(256, n_samples)`.

        If max_samples is larger than the number of samples provided,
        all samples will be used for all trees (no sampling).

    contamination : 'auto' or float, default='auto'
        The amount of contamination of the data set, i.e. the proportion
        of outliers in the data set. Used when fitting to define the threshold
        on the scores of the samples.

            - If 'auto', the threshold is determined as in the
              original paper.
            - If float, the contamination should be in the range (0, 0.5].

    max_features : int or float, default=1.0
        The number of features to draw from X to train each base estimator.

            - If int, then draw `max_features` features.
            - If float, then draw `max(1, int(max_features * n_features_in_))` features.

        Note: using a float number less than 1.0 or integer less than number of
        features will enable feature subsampling and leads to a longer runtime.

    bootstrap : bool, default=False
        If True, individual trees are fit on random subsets of the training
        data sampled with replacement. If False, sampling without replacement
        is performed.

    feature_combinations : int, default=2
        The number of features to on average combine to consider at each split.
        For more information, see `ExtraObliqueDecisionTreeRegressor`.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel for both :meth:`fit` and
        :meth:`predict`. ``None`` means 1 unless in a
        :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means using all
        processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>` for more details.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the pseudo-randomness of the selection of the feature
        and split values for each branching step and each tree in the forest.

        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls the verbosity of the tree building process.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimator_ : :class:`~sklearn.tree.ExtraTreeRegressor` instance
        The child estimator template used to create the collection of
        fitted sub-estimators.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2
           `base_estimator_` was renamed to `estimator_`.

    base_estimator_ : ExtraTreeRegressor instance
        The child estimator template used to create the collection of
        fitted sub-estimators.

        .. deprecated:: 1.2
            `base_estimator_` is deprecated and will be removed in 1.4.
            Use `estimator_` instead.

    estimators_ : list of ExtraTreeRegressor instances
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    estimators_features_ : list of ndarray
        The subset of drawn features for each base estimator.

    estimators_samples_ : list of ndarray
        The subset of drawn samples (i.e., the in-bag samples) for each base
        estimator.

    max_samples_ : int
        The actual number of samples.

    offset_ : float
        Offset used to define the decision function from the raw scores. We
        have the relation: ``decision_function = score_samples - offset_``.
        ``offset_`` is defined as follows. When the contamination parameter is
        set to "auto", the offset is equal to -0.5 as the scores of inliers are
        close to 0 and the scores of outliers are close to -1. When a
        contamination parameter different than "auto" is provided, the offset
        is defined in such a way we obtain the expected number of outliers
        (samples with decision function < 0) in training.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

        Gaussian distributed dataset.

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation is based on an ensemble of ExtraTreeRegressor. The
    maximum depth of each tree is set to ``ceil(log_2(n))`` where
    :math:`n` is the number of samples used to build the tree
    (see (Liu et al., 2008) for more details).
