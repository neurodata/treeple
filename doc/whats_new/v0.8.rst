Version 0.8
===========

This development fixes a major bug with (CO)MIGHT, where low sample sizes produce biased tree
posteriors, which is fixed by stratifying the sampling of the dataset to ensure that each class
is represented in the bootstrap sample. Additionally, the release includes a number of bug fixes
and improvements to the codebase.

Changelog
---------

- |Fix| Previously missing-values in ``X`` input array for treeple estimators
    did not raise an error, and silently ran, assuming the missing-values were
    encoded as infinity value. This is now fixed, and the estimators will raise an
    ValueError if missing-values are encountered in ``X`` input array.
    By `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#264`)
- |Feature| Simulations in ``treeple.datasets.hyppo`` now throw a warning instead
    of an error when the number of samples is less than the number of dimensions.
    By `Sambit Panda`_ (:pr:`#279`)
- |API| :class:`treeple.HonestForestClassifier` now has ``bootstrap=True`` as the default
    argument. By `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#274`)
- |API| Removed all instances of ``FeatureImportanceForestClassifier`` and outdated
    MIGHT code. By `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#274`)
- |Fix| Fixed a bug in the ``treeple.HonestForestClassifier`` where posteriors
    estimated on oob samples were biased when there was a low number of samples
    due to imbalance in the classes when ``bootstrap=True``.
    By `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#283`)
