Version 0.8
===========

**In Development**

Changelog
---------

- |Fix| Previously missing-values in ``X`` input array for sktree estimators
    did not raise an error, and silently ran, assuming the missing-values were
    encoded as infinity value. This is now fixed, and the estimators will raise an
    ValueError if missing-values are encountered in ``X`` input array.
    By `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#264`)
- |Feature| Simulations in ``sktree.datasets.hyppo`` now throw a warning instead
    of an error when the number of samples is less than the number of dimensions.
    By `Sambit Panda`_ (:pr:`#279`)
- |API| :class:`sktree.HonestForestClassifier` now has ``bootstrap=True`` as the default
    argument. By `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#274`)
- |API| Removed all instances of ``FeatureImportanceForestClassifier`` and outdated
    MIGHT code. By `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#274`)
- |API| :class:`sktree.tree.MultiViewDecisionTreeClassifier` do not have the
    ``apply_max_features_per_feature_set`` argument anymore. Instead, the
    ``max_features`` argument is used to control the number of features to
    consider when looking for the best split within each feature set explicitly.
    By `Adam Li`_ :pr:`#247`.
