Version 0.2
===========

This release is a major release, with many new features and improvements.
For instance, we have added a new implementation of the extended isolation forest,
enabled all decision trees to take advantage of ``partial_fit`` meaning trees have streaming
capabilities. Moreover, we have added an analogous implementation of extra-trees for oblique-trees.
Finally, this release includes a highly experimental feature for multivariate high-dimensional
hypothesis testing using permutation forests and a feature importance testing forest.
