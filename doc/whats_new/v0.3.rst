Version 0.3
===========

This release includes a number of bug fixes and enhancements related to hypothesis testing with decision trees.
Moreover, we have added an experimental multi-view decision tree / random forest, which considers multiple views
of the data when building trees. The documentation page has also undergone an organizational overhaul
making it easier for users to find examples related to specific use cases.
