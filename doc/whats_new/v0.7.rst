Version 0.7
===========

**In Development**

Changelog
---------

- |Feature| Introduce a new light-weight class for fitting honest forests while
    permuting the covariate index :class:`sktree.stats.PermutationHonestForestClassifier`,
    by `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#211`)
- |Feature| Introduce a new class method ``predict_proba_per_tree`` for all
    Forest classifiers, which will predict the probability per tree and keep the
    output as a ``(n_estimators, n_samples, n_classes)`` output,
    by `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#211`)
- |Feature| Introduce a new class fitted attribute ``oob_samples_`` for all
    Forest models, which will keep track of the samples used.
    by `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#211`)
- |Feature| Introduce a new set of simulations based on Marron and Wand 1992.
    by `Sambit Panda`_ (:pr:`#203`)
- |Feature| :func:`sktree.stats.build_coleman_forest` and :func:`sktree.stats.build_permutation_forest`
    are added to compute p-values given an estimator and permutation-estimator, `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#222`)
- |API| :func:`sktree.datasets.make_trunk_classification` for generating trunk mixture and Marron-Wand
    simulations are separated out into :func:`sktree.datasets.make_marron_wand_classification` and
    :func:`sktree.datasets.make_trunk_mixture_classification`, `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#227`)
- |API| :class:`sktree.HonestForestClassifier` and :class:`sktree.tree.HonestTreeClassifier`
    now overwrite all parameters set by the underlying ``tree_estimator`` and allow you to directly
    pass any extra parameters that ``tree_estimator`` has compared to the original
    :class:`~sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`, `Adam Li`_ (:pr:`#228`)
